\begin{frame}{Regular WAR}

    Really simple card game:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Two players get half of a deck of cards
        \item Each of them repeat playing the top card of their deck, the card
            with higher value wins and the winner takes both cards
        \item The player who has all of the cards at the end wins
    \end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Adding Auction Rounds}

    Extending the game to make it a sufficient study:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Any number of players may play
        \item Each player starts out with a whole deck of cards
        \item Every round, they may choose any of the cards in their hand to
            play
        \item The highest card value each round wins, and the cards go to the
            players' wins pile
        \item When the player runs out of cards in their hand, their wins pile
            becomes their hand
        \item The player who has all of the cards at the end wins
    \end{enumerate}
