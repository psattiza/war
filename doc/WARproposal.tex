We chose to do a modified version of the card game war.
To start, we give each player an entire deck of cards.
The game is played until there is only one player with all the cards.

Each round, both players choose a single card from their hand to play. After
the players choose a card for that round, the cards are shown to all the other players. The highest
card from that round wins all the cards played that round and keeps these cards
but does not put them immediately into their hand. In case of a tie, the
players that tied must select 3 cards to discard and an additional card to play.
The winner of this sub-round, wins all the cards played that round.

Once a player runs out of cards in their hand, they take the other cards they have
won and make those cards their new hand. This makes sure that all cards in a hand
must be played before any won cards may be played. This continues until only one
player has cards. They are the winner, everyone else loses.
